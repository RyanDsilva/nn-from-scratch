# Neural Networks From Scratch

ðŸŒŸ Implementation of Neural Networks from Scratch Using Python &amp; Numpy ðŸŒŸ

> Uses Python 3.7.4

#### This repository has detailed math equations and graphs for every feature implemented that can be used to serve as basis for greater, in-depth understanding of Neural Networks

## Setup ðŸ’»

```bash
git clone <url>
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Roadmap ðŸ“‘

- [x] Activation Functions
- [ ] Loss Functions
- [ ] Optimizers
- [ ] Neuron Architecture
- [ ] Layer Architecture
- [ ] Wrapper Class
- [ ] Hyperparameters Configuration

##### This project is not meant to be production ready but instead serve as the foundation repository to understand the in-depth working of Neural Networks down to the mathematics of the task.

###### Collaborations in implementing and maintaining this project are welcome. Kindly reach out to me if interested.
